# Agentic AI Components in the Insurance Calculator Architecture

This document identifies and describes the components in the architecture that are governed by Agentic AI technologies.

## Overview

The Insurance Calculator application uses Agentic AI technology in six key components:

1. **Premium Calculator**
2. **Medical Risk Analysis**
3. **Vector Store**
4. **CrewAI Orchestration**
5. **LLM Inference (Ollama/Llama)**
6. **AI Underwriting Logic**

## Component Details

### 1. Premium Calculator

**Location:** Backend Services Layer

**Description:** The Premium Calculator uses AI algorithms to determine appropriate insurance premiums based on multiple factors including age, credit score, and medical history. It combines traditional actuarial methods with machine learning approaches to produce more accurate and personalized premium calculations.

**Key Features:**
- Risk factor weighting using AI models
- Dynamic premium adjustment based on historical data
- Integration with medical risk analysis for comprehensive assessment

### 2. Medical Risk Analysis

**Location:** Backend Services Layer

**Description:** This component analyzes medical history data using natural language processing to identify risk factors that may impact insurance premiums. It can understand complex medical terminology, identify relationships between conditions, and assess the severity of health issues.

**Key Features:**
- Medical text analysis using NLP
- Risk factor identification and categorization
- Severity assessment of medical conditions
- Historical case comparison

### 3. Vector Store

**Location:** Data Layer

**Description:** The Vector Store is a specialized database that stores vector embeddings of medical conditions, risk profiles, and historical cases. It enables semantic similarity search, allowing the system to find similar cases and risk patterns even when the exact terminology differs.

**Key Features:**
- Vector embedding storage and retrieval
- Semantic similarity search
- Dimension reduction for efficient storage
- Fast nearest-neighbor queries

### 4. CrewAI Orchestration

**Location:** Agentic AI Layer

**Description:** CrewAI serves as the coordination layer for multiple AI agents within the system. It manages the workflow between different AI components, ensures they work together coherently, and maintains the overall decision-making process.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Task allocation and prioritization
- Agent communication protocols
- Process monitoring and logging

### 5. LLM Inference (Ollama/Llama)

**Location:** Agentic AI Layer

**Description:** This component provides the foundation for natural language understanding and generation throughout the application. Using local LLM inference with Ollama and Llama models, it enables the system to process textual information, generate reports, and assist in decision-making without relying on external API calls.

**Key Features:**
- Local LLM inference
- Natural language understanding
- Text generation for reports and explanations
- Context-aware processing of insurance-specific terminology

### 6. AI Underwriting Logic

**Location:** Agentic AI Layer

**Description:** The AI Underwriting Logic applies artificial intelligence to the insurance underwriting process. It combines data from multiple sources to make informed decisions about risk acceptance, premium pricing, and policy terms, following regulatory guidelines while optimizing for business goals.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-factor decision making
- Regulatory compliance checking
- Risk assessment automation
- Explanation generation for underwriting decisions

## Architectural Integration

These Agentic AI components work together in the following workflow:

1. User inputs information through the Angular frontend
2. The information is sent to the backend via HTTP requests
3. The Premium Calculator component receives the request and initiates the analysis
4. Medical information is sent to the Medical Risk Analysis component
5. The Medical Risk Analysis leverages the Vector Store for similar case comparison
6. The CrewAI Orchestration manages the workflow between components
7. LLM Inference (Ollama/Llama) provides language understanding and generation capabilities
8. The AI Underwriting Logic makes the final determination on policies and premiums
9. Results are returned to the frontend for display to the user

## Benefits of Agentic AI Approach

The use of Agentic AI in this architecture provides several advantages:

- **Accuracy:** More precise risk assessment and premium calculation
- **Personalization:** Tailored insurance offerings based on individual profiles
- **Efficiency:** Automated processing of applications and underwriting
- **Transparency:** AI-generated explanations of decision factors
- **Privacy:** Local LLM inference reduces the need to share sensitive data externally

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the Agentic AI components include:

- Integration with additional data sources for more comprehensive risk assessment
- Advanced fraud detection using anomaly detection algorithms
- Continuous learning from new cases to improve accuracy over time
- Expanded explanation capabilities for regulatory compliance
- Multi-modal processing to handle different types of medical documentation
